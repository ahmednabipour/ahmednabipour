Smart Face Less IOT Based Parcel Locker (2020-2021)
Ganje is a smart parcel locker which could be interacted with using your smartphone via internet. The project was a collaboration between 5 divisions of mechanical, electronics, software, design and business. My job was to connect all divisions together and also I was the head of mechanical division. Our mission was to technically design and manufacture a parcel locker with all the necessary features such as IP, modularity and out door security standards. We mainly used metal fabrication (sheet metal) processes for manufacturing and, design for environment was our number one priority.	                          Click to open the link to the project.

Mice VR Setup (2019-2020)
V0 design of a setup which would act as a treadmill for a mice to run on. By projecting an image of a maze in front of the mice, the mice would learn to solve for an virtual maze and use the data for neural science research. 

Mowing Robot (2019)
Design, coding and manufacturing of a robot which uses a picture to generate a Gcode for its blade position. It cuts the grass in different heights to draw the picture on to the grass. Uses a mobile application to communicate with the personal and allow the controlling person for manual overrides. It also uses a rotary sensor for X positioning on the field.

Air Conditioning IOT (2019)
Monitoring sensor values of an Havaram Corp air conditioner, on the internet for better control system and data extraction.

Adv Robotics e-puck Localization (2019)
By extracting the sensor model and the motion model of an e-puck, we used a particle filter in order to localize the robot in a maze in real time. Our model could with stand kidnapping and sensor model change due to changes in exterior lighting.

Plant Lighting (2019)
Design, coding and manufacturing of a light control unit for plant. This setup would control allow the researcher to find the effects of different lights and durations on plants leaves.

 Robotic Toy With Remote Smart Glove Controller (2018-2019)
This toy was designed for autistic kids. A robotic doll which you could wirelessly control using a smart glove. The glove could read the position of your fingers using resistor sensors which we developed and it cost around 5$. Using accelerometer, hand rotation and movement would also be recorded. This smart glove, compared to other types of smart gloves has higher accuracy and much lower production cost.
The glove was a rigid surface made by 3d printing, which your hand could wear it. The robotic doll had a 3d printed modular skeleton and a plexiglass platform. The doll was capable of moving its arms and rotating from the bottom.

2 Dimensional Ultrasonic Radar (2018-2019)
A setup made out of an ultrasonic module attached to a servo motor which could communicate to a python program in the laptop via serial communication, we built a 2d radar. We had to use lot of  hardware and software based filters on the data for noise reduction. 
Arduino Online Course (2018-2019)
A learning website with the purpose of free courses for university students. Besides cofounding this business we developed a full course on Arduino.

Self Learning Crawler Based on RL (2018)
Design, coding and manufacturing of a crawler which used reinforcement learning to learn how to crawl in one direction using 2 servo motors as itâ€™s hands and one rotary encoder as itâ€™s measuring sensor. The crawler could learn the best way to crawl in different trains.
