## Smart Face Less IOT Based Parcel Locker (2020-Peresent)
Ganje is a smart parcel locker which could be interacted with using your smartphone via internet. The project was a collaboration between 5 divisions of mechanical, electronics, software, design and business. My job was to connect all divisions together and also I was the head of mechanical division. Our mission was to technically design and manufacture a parcel locker with all the necessary features such as IP, modularity and out door security standards. We mainly used metal fabrication (sheet metal) processes for manufacturing and, design for environment was our number one priority.	                          

## Mice VR Setup (2019-2020)
V0 design of a setup which would act as a treadmill for a mice to run on. By projecting an image of a maze in front of the mice, the mice would learn to solve for an virtual maze and use the data for neural science research. 

## Mowing Robot (2019)
Design, coding and manufacturing of a robot which uses a picture to generate a Gcode for its blade position. It cuts the grass in different heights to draw the picture on to the grass. Uses a mobile application to communicate with the personal and allow the controlling person for manual overrides. It also uses a rotary sensor for X positioning on the field.

## Air Conditioning IOT (2019)
Monitoring sensor values of an Havaram Corp air conditioner, on the internet for better control system and data extraction.

## Adv Robotics e-puck Localization (2019)
By extracting the sensor model and the motion model of an e-puck, we used a particle filter in order to localize the robot in a maze in real time. Our model could with stand kidnapping and sensor model change due to changes in exterior lighting.

## Plant Lighting (2019)
Design, coding and manufacturing of a light control unit for plant. This setup would control allow the researcher to find the effects of different lights and durations on plants leaves.

## Robotic Toy With Remote Smart Glove Controller (2018-2019)
This toy was designed for autistic kids. A robotic doll which you could wirelessly control using a smart glove. The glove could read the position of your fingers using resistor sensors which we developed and it cost around 5$. Using accelerometer, hand rotation and movement would also be recorded. This smart glove, compared to other types of smart gloves has higher accuracy and much lower production cost.
The glove was a rigid surface made by 3d printing, which your hand could wear it. The robotic doll had a 3d printed modular skeleton and a plexiglass platform. The doll was capable of moving its arms and rotating from the bottom.

## 2 Dimensional Ultrasonic Radar (2018-2019)
A setup made out of an ultrasonic module attached to a servo motor which could communicate to a python program in the laptop via serial communication, we built a 2d radar. We had to use lot of  hardware and software based filters on the data for noise reduction. 
Arduino Online Course (2018-2019)
A learning website with the purpose of free courses for university students. Besides cofounding this business we developed a full course on Arduino.

## Self Learning Crawler Based on RL (2018)
Design, coding and manufacturing of a crawler which used reinforcement learning to learn how to crawl in one direction using 2 servo motors as it’s hands and one rotary encoder as it’s measuring sensor. The crawler could learn the best way to crawl in different trains. 
 Modular Cool pad (2018)
A simple foldable cool pad made out of plexiglass which could be used for different laptops for different configurations.

## Ball and Plate (2018)
Full development of the ball and plate setup, and controller design for such a plant. The setup had 2 servo motors in order to control plate’s angle, a video camera for 2d ball positioning on plate, and by connecting the servos through an Arduino to computer, we designed a control for such a plant in MATLAB.

## Window Washing Robot (2017-2018)
V0 design of a window washing robot for buildings.

## AC to DC Converter (2017-2018)
Full development of a simple AC to DC converter for a course project.

## Ball and Wheel (2017)
Design and manufacturing of the ball and wheel setup, and controller design, simulation and implementation for such a plant. We used an Arduino mega to drive a dc motor and used a camera for ball positioning on top of the wheel.

## Plotter (2016-2017)
Design, coding and manufacturing of a 2d plotter which uses a pen for drawing and it uses an image to draw on the paper of any given surface. We wanted to sell the product to coffee shops for a unique costumer experience.

## IOT Watering Control Unit (2016)
Design, coding and manufacturing of an Arduino based control unit, developed for agricultural purposes for small to medium size yards. It is capable of communicating through internet and BT. It also has a small display and the capability of supporting over 30 separate control units directly (such as valves or any kind of actuators), and many other units using serial communication.
